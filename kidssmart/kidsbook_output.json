At Nexus, we believe your fitness journey should be an exhilarating experience that keeps you coming back for more! We are a family-oriented Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and martial-arts academy in Coburg. BJJ is an energetic, inclusive, and practical sport that children love to play. We offer kid’s training and classes that cater for girls and boys from ages as young as 4 years and older. Kids approach BJJ like structured play – but it teaches invaluable lessons about how to develop their bodies and minds to defend themselves using technique and position, rather than strength and aggression. This personal development overcomes fear and builds self-esteem, thereby reducing the likelihood of physical confrontation ever even happening. We always recommend 2-3 classes per week to give the program maximum learning. The lessons your children learn here go beyond the mat and boost performance in all areas of their lives – from the sporting field to the classroom and later into adulthood. Together with self-defence, our program works to develop: In every class they do, the kids experience the undeniable success of practised skills and strategies triumphing over simple aggression and force. Like learning to play music, we see this simple example of work = success as a key lesson in character development for children. Plus, there are regular gradings and advancements that recognise effort and skill acquisition to keep kids engaged. All our kids class instructors and coaches are experienced BJJ practitioners who love to teach children. They are local parents with young kids of their own and hold current Victorian Working with Children Checks. These coaches are assisted by members of our youth squad to help the children connect with younger role models who have benefited from applying themselves to this rewarding martial art. Classes are conducted in our large modern training facility, with a focus on learning in a fun and safe environment. We run kid’s BJJ classes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday if you would like to see a session. You are also welcome to come and view the centre any time we’re open. We love that Coburg, Pascoe Vale, Reservoir, Brunswick, Glenroy, Hadfield, Fawkner and the surrounding northern Melbourne suburbs are a culturally diverse area. We have members from all sorts of backgrounds and cultures – all getting on the mat and learning together. We are proud of the culture that has developed in the academy, and insist every student understands and adheres to our Code of Conduct. • Honour: I will endeavour to uphold a strong moral character and ethical principles. • Integrity: I will act and behave in accordance with these training values both inside and outside the academy. • Respect: I will exhibit respect for my fellow students regardless of age, physical ability, gender, nationality, or religion. • Self-control: I will strive to understand the consequences of my actions, and use every resource to promote peaceful outcomes at all times. • Character: I will strive to attain my goal through hard work and the development of my character. • Self-discipline: I understand that Jiu Jitsu techniques are for self-defence purposes only and must never be used inappropriately in the schoolyard, at work or at home. We are often asked by parents if BJJ will help their children fight against bullies. Our response is that BJJ builds character which stops most of the bullying and reduces the chances of ever having to fight in the first place. If a situation turns physical however, our BJJ kids are absolutely developing skills to handle this. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a cornerstone martial art of every professional Mixed Martial Art fighter in the world for a reason – it works incredibly well.

There are 3 Wing Chun Schools, in Abbotsford and Greensborough, suburbs of Melbourne, as well as Bendigo. Wing Chun is a practical close range self defense/fighting style suitable for males and females of all ages. The science of wing chun kung fu and its approach to bio-mechanics, makes it a very practical and effective self defense system, using a common sense approach to uplift one's martial skill, confidence, coordination, balance and fitness. Bendigo Shaolin Jee Shin Wing Chun Kung fu is a branch of the Shaolin Jee Shin Wing Chun Association. The lineage stems from the Leung Bik/Yip Man system. Wing Chun Kung Fu is a martial arts self defense system immortalised by the legendary Bruce Lee. The popularity of wing chun kung fu is highlighted in today's wing chun movies with the popular Yip Man wing chun movie series.

That’s why we’ve designed a thoughtful early learning journey for children aged 2–3 and 3–5 years, where exploration is encouraged, and wonder is woven into every moment. Wonderhood offers more than a class — it's a premium, nature-based learning experience that nurtures young minds through hands-on discovery, creative expression, and gentle guidance. Our sessions are rooted in nature, paced with care, and designed to spark joy in every little explorer. Children dig, plant, build, and engage with natural materials, fostering a deep connection with the world around them. Each 60-minute session follows a gentle rhythm that blends sensory play, creativity, storytelling, and reflection — promoting confidence and independence. Our intentionally small groups ensure individual attention, a sense of belonging, and the freedom to learn at each child’s own pace. Each child receives a personal journal — a keepsake of their learning journey, filled with stickers, drawings, and weekly discoveries. We extend the experience beyond class with beautifully designed take-home guides, activity ideas, and insights to continue exploring together at home. ○ Each session is designed to feel familiar, safe, and magical, featuring: ○ Warm Welcome & Sing-Along – A joyful way to start together ○ Sensory Guessing Game – Hands-on play that sparks curiosity ○ Nature-Based Exploration – Digging, planting, and discovering nature’s tiny treasures ○ Creative Craft – Imaginative projects using natural materials ○ Storytelling & Reflection – Sharing meaningful stories that bring learning to life ○ Explorer Journal Sticker – A special memory from each class ○ Goodbye & Wrap-Up – A thoughtful close that builds confidence and connection To nurture young minds through nature-inspired play, fostering curiosity, creativity, and confidence in a supportive and engaging environment. A world where childhood is filled with wonder — where learning is hands-on, curiosity is celebrated, and nature becomes the ultimate classroom.

Dyslexia | Literacy | Dysgraphia | Writing | Dyscalculia | Numeracy | A.D.H.D | A.P.D | E.F.D At Essential Learning & Tutoring, we use an evidence based, multi-sensory, teaching approach to develop a tailored program for your child’s unique learning style. The Spalding© method is just one of the methods used at Essential Learning and Tutoring. It is a highly effective method of instruction, for dyslexics and learners who may or may not have a diagnosed learning difficulty, that has stood the test of time. It is a highly structured, sequential, multisensory program that was specifically designed for dyslexics. It is the foundation from which a fully customised, one-on-one tutoring plan will be designed and delivered, allowing the tutor to pace and adjust the program depending on the learners needs. Your child’s program will be designed with their unique learning style in mind. We will break the information down into to small achievable segments allowing for optimal leaning to take place. We will give you and your child the support and confidence require to help them get back on track. Early intervention is essential for the success of your child. Jennifer is a registered primary school teacher who has worked closely with dyslexic children, teens, and adults over the past 30 years. She has taught in and held many positions of leadership at all levels in the Primary school system, from Prep to grade six. Jennifer has been operating a specialised tutoring business on the Mornington Peninsula for the past 25+ years working with clients from ages 6 to 86. Over the years she has continued to study the many facets of learning difficulties, develop programs for teachers and individual children, and ran workshops for the community. At Essential Learning & Tutoring, Jenny’s focus is to enhance learning outcomes and to do this she designs her programs around research dedicated to understanding the memory process. These activities are reinforced with success at the end of each session to improve emotional and educational outcomes. Our approach is not about ‘teaching’ or ‘telling’. By firstly approaching the child with respect, we assist individuals to engage in learning by creating an environment that is safe. Jennifer believes that every child is gifted with the capacity to learn, it is just up to the educator to find the right combination of techniques to suit the child.

Regardless of their learning style or ability, students from year 2 to year 12 will love meeting and exceeding their learning goals, gaining the confidence to flourish in the classroom. Pioneers Tutoring was founded by Gabby, a teacher with a Bachelors, Masters, and 14 years of experience under her belt. Gabby confesses that when she attended school, she lacked confidence and often hid away at the back of the classroom. She recognises that every student has the capacity to learn, and she strives to provide a fun, rewarding, engaging experience for every learner at Pioneers Tutoring. As a mother herself, Gabby understands first-hand a parents’ desire to see their children thrive in the classroom and realise their full academic potential.

Students enjoy their lessons and quickly develop a varied repertoire of performance pieces that they enjoy performing at concerts for fellow students, family and friends. Students who choose to sit for music exams obtain excellent results proportional to their preparation time. Australian born John Barton created Music Logic® – an exciting revolutionary system that has students reading and understanding the language of music 10 times more quickly and easily than traditional methods. Whether leading workshops in Australia or overseas the progress of the participants is remarkable. There are often emotional scenes where participants with years of conventional lessons experience, see how much sweat and tears they could have saved. In a two day workshop, total beginners are reading and playing music that conventionally can take two years to achieve. As well as coaching students into obtaining extraordinary results John also trains individuals into becoming powerful Music Logic® Teachers.

Over the years two more campuses have opened – Lyndhurst Primary School and our state-of-the-art studios in Clyde North – and our name changed to uLearn Music. Our philosophy, though, has remained the same – providing local, affordable lessons that are R.E.F – Relevant, Educational and Fun. Our founder and original teacher, David Taylor, is still teaching and managing uLearn. Our teachers are made up of professional musicians, career educators and university students. We are very proud that 3 of our teachers have come through our music school themselves as students in their younger age. How exciting that they are now sharing their joy of music with the new generation, while continuing their studies to be career educators and profesional musicians.

SpeaksCraft (Formerly known as Talent Club Australia) was founded to help children build the confidence to speak, express, and lead in all aspects of life. Starting in Sydney, we saw a gap in structured, fun, and engaging communication programs tailored for young people. Our belief is simple: every child has a voice that deserves to be heard. We’ve since grown into a national organisation, expanding to Melbourne and Perth, with in-person and online classes. We created the SpeaksCraft program to deliver a world-class, 4-in-1 curriculum combining public speaking, debating, drama, and creative writing—designed to help children thrive both in school and in life. Our mission is to empower the next generation of leaders by developing their confidence in communication. We do this by offering practical, interactive, and emotionally intelligent programs that are aligned with schools, real-world skills and the Australian Speech Communication Association (ASCA) curriculum.

It gives you the opportunity to exercise your whole body without even feeling like you are at the gym. Almost anybody can practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It is not limited to the sporty, strong and athletic types. In fact, boys and girls as young as 4 can begin training! Furthermore, while training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, you constantly learn new skills, develop friendships, and maintain an overall healthier life style. Otherwise known as ‘human chess’, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners develop different strategies and techniques to win their match. Students can be exposed to hundreds of different techniques within their first few years of training. This keeps each class new, fresh and exciting. As for kids, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a great way to build core strength and make new friends. Knowing that many real-life encounters end up on the ground, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a fantastic last line of defence for kids. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu prides itself on being known as the ‘gentle art’, where a smaller, weaker opponent can use techniques and leverage to defend themselves against a much larger opponent. Murat Besnek is a First-Degree Black Belt under Peter de Been, and has competed and won many State, National and Pan Pacific medals. Also, as mentioned above, Besnek Jiu Jitsu was once solely a place where people trained for competition. However, these days, Besnek Jiu Jitsu is more predicated on creating a balanced lifestyle rather being a school which solely emphasises competition. This does not mean competition training is not available at Besnek Jiu Jitsu, it is just that the goal has now become much broader due to demand. While training Jiu Jitsu, Murat also aims to provide an opportunity for members to regain physical fitness and mental well-being. Furthermore, he also wants to offer an avenue for members to socialise in a healthy way, utilising the time spent away from home and family in a more productive manner. As for kids, Murat wants to give them a chance to have fun and get strong while learning practical Jiu Jitsu techniques. Jiu Jitsu is great for kids as it keeps their minds occupied while helping them learn how to defend themselves. It is also an opportunity for them to build friendships and practise social skills all the while staying active. It is also important to assert that Murat understands very well to excel at the elite level in any field requires total dedication. He is more than happy to accommodate and assist anybody trying to win major titles in Jiu Jitsu or MMA. He did dedicate himself for many years attempting to make the National Basketball League (NBA), completing his Ph.D. in Economics, and trying to win major titles in Jiu Jitsu. He still currently competes internationally in Jiu Jitsu competitions a couple of times a year chasing that dream of winning an international medal while working full-time as an academic teaching Economics at Charles Sturt and La Trobe University.

During water safety weeks children come to swim in clothes without goggles and a cap. This mimics a more realistic scenario to prepare the children for different dangerous situations and scenarios. • Fitting PFDs (personal flotation device, or ‘life jackets’) We also encourage children to ask questions and we talk to them about safety indifferent aquatic environments. The importance of water safety is critical for both children and parents so they understand and respect the aquatic environments. We run a comprehensive school swimming program for the local schools and kinders in the area. The benefit of school groups running their swimming program at our facility is we know so many of the students already as we teach them on a weekly basis. We know their correct levels, strengths and weaknesses. The kids get a real buzz when they see us during school hours and also during their weekly swimming lesson. Starfish Swim School offers a Pre-Squad for those who have completed the Learn to Swim program. The focus is on increasing endurance, refining stroke technique, development, turns, starts and finishes for all four strokes. We introduce the kids to competitive swimming. Starfish Swim School has partnered with Rodney Skudar, owner of Academy of Swimming. This partnership allows our students the ability and facilities necessary, once they have outgrown the Starfish pool, to further their progression and development in swimming.

We teach children aquatic survival skills not just water familiarisation. Children from 6 months old learn vital swimming skills to save themselves. Designed to help with the step between survival lessons and stroke lessons. Improve your child’s swimming confidence and competence. Afloat Swim Lessons deliver Australia’s safest, most effective, accelerated aquatic survival program for non verbal infants and young children. The program focuses on aquatic survival skills tailored to children aged 6 months to 6 years. Drowning doesn’t occur due to a lack of swimming ability. Drowning occurs when a person is unable to hold and maintain an effective body position for breathing. With over 70% of children under 5 years drowning due to falls into water, this means the child is not intending to swim when they drown. They access water unnoticed, fall, become disorientated, usually fully clothed which is a completely different sensory experience for them, revert to a vertical position and eventually cannot gain a breath. Breath is life. No chid is drown-proof, and nothing replaces supervision or restricting access to water, however teaching a child to float could give the child, parents or emergency services those crucial seconds or minutes which could prevent further tragedy. The survival skills we teach are designed to form the final layer of protection in the prevention against drowning. With Afloat Swim School each child is skilled in WEEKS not years, because taking years to teach a child aquatic survival skills may be too late.

Our holiday programs and festivals provide enriched learning experiences for kids seeking more! Many people confuse the terms ‘gifted’ and ‘special’ and consequently maintain that ‘all children are gifted’. It is absolutely true that every child is unique and special, and that each one has a personal profile of strengths and weaknesses. That is not to say that every child is cognitively or creatively gifted, in the same way that not all children are gifted at sport. Giftedness is a complex concept and definitions are changing as our understanding of the nature of intelligence and brain function is improving. There are many definitions of giftedness and talent. Francoys Gagné's Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent is currently a widely adopted definition: “Gifted students are those whose potential is distinctly above average in one or more of the following domains: intellectual, creative, social and physical. Talented students are those whose skills are distinctly above average in one or more areas of human performance.” Giftedness is not an indication of performance or achievement, but of potential. Whether a child is able to reach that potential is moderated by their environment – at home, at school and in their community.

All children learning an instrument participate in our group classes, which provide regular performance opportunities and develop musicianship skills. Our dynamic music community encourages social interaction and inter-generational bonding through music with group classes, concerts and parent support forums throughout the year where parents, teachers and children can all learn from each other. The Music Playground uses music to connect people of all ages, with interactive group learning sessions, music experiences and regular performance opportunities for its musicians. We run sessions for carers and children to make music together. Children have the option of learning a musical instrument with our teachers from age 3. Our organisation continues to offer group music sessions for older children, where they participate in marimba band, performance practice, music theory and singing skills. We run a free community choir for parents-to-be, teaching lullabies and ways to use music to bond with a baby before and after birth, as well as offering expectant parents a chance to meet and sing with others to lift the spirits. It is known that babies respond to familiar sounds they heard in utero. Our choir provides the opportunity for unborn babies to hear and feel music, and develop an early connection to the sound of their own mother's song. We also offer free music classes for carers with babies under six months. Our programs are founded on the musical pedagogies of Orff, Suzuki, Kodály, using qualified staff. An independentent organisation (not a franchise) we offer a unique blend of these musical philosophies. Our key belief is: When you create an environment to nurture musical growth, everyone can be musical, and be as comfortable sharing a tune as they are sharing a story. We want everyone to experience the joy of synchronising with others through music. The non musical benefits of music learning are also evident, with music strengthening language, listening, turn taking, sharing, waiting, being thorough, perseverance and commitment, delayed gratification and patience.

Whether you want to pick up the flute as a fun new hobby, or you want to push yourself to excel and succeed, you will be able to develop these goals and experience the encouragement and motivation to achieve. Rachel has experience preparing students with excellent results for performances, AMEB examinations, VCE music and competitions. Music lessons are designed to be musically rewarding, mentally stimulating and ultimately enjoyable for each student. Some goals that we can work together towards include: • Learning how and what to practise for better results • How to use your body to create the best possible sound for your instrument Student concerts are held twice a year to provide budding musicians with the opportunity to perform. Performance is a crucial aspect of music education, offering numerous benefits for students. Regular performances enhance technical proficiency, boost self-confidence, and provide a platform for emotional expression and artistic interpretation. The joy of sharing music with an audience brings personal satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment, making performance an integral part of a musician's holistic development. Rachel's musical journey commenced with early piano lessons, yet her profound passion became unmistakable the moment she picked up a flute at the age of 9. At the age of 14, Rachel earned her Associate Diploma with Distinction in flute performance (AMEB), followed by the achievement of the Licentiate Diploma with Distinction the subsequent year. She furthered her musical education by completing a Bachelor of Music at the Queensland Conservatorium, where she actively participated in orchestral and chamber performances while achieving success in numerous music competitions. Rachel enriched her artistic capabilities through the performance program at the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM) in Melbourne. Her versatility is evident as she seamlessly transitions between roles as a soloist, chamber musician, and orchestral performer. Notable collaborations include appearances with Orchestra Victoria, the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, the internationally acclaimed vocal group Voces8, and performances alongside distinguished musicians such as Stefan Dohr, Denis Bouriakov, and Gábor Takács-Nagy. Considering music a cherished gift, Rachel finds immense joy in imparting this pleasure to others. Whether on the stage as a performer, or in a studio engaging in one-on-one teaching, she is dedicated to sharing the beauty of music with others. Rachel leverages her extensive knowledge and experience, acquired through performances and collaborations with renowned pedagogues and flautists, to deliver both inspirational and practical flute instruction to her students.

No heavy instrument to lug around! One caveat is that there is a bit of a limit as to the age that can play the flute as very young students may struggle to hold the instrument. Even still, students as young as 6 can begin flute lessons if they meet the physical requirements. The flute is one of the oldest instruments that is versatile enough to play many different genres of music including classical, jazz and pop styles. It has a rich repertoire of pieces available starting from the French conservatory, to adaptations of pop music or even Irish folk tunes! It’s a beautiful soaring instrument that can play any melody but it also works in an ensemble with other flutes to form harmonies. Taking flute lessons is great as either a first instrument or, if you already know an instrument, to gain a broader understanding of different types of instruments. It can be used as a stepping stone to a develop a stronger sense of melody and to fine tune different aspects of musicianship which aren’t commonly developed learning the piano. As well as the fundamentals of note reading and rhythm We can also prepare for AMEB exams. With further consultation we can decide what will serve you best. For young beginner piano lessons, Phavian incorporates Whole Body Learning into lessons so that students learning is embedded within a multi-sensory approach to learning music.

I employ a tailored approach depending on your age group to ensure the absolute best learning experience. I tend to find that young learners have the least “bad” habits in playing an instrument, whilst more advanced students may need months, and some, years of technical re-adjustment. • My program will take you through repertoire pieces that will develop your emotional inner abilities. • Focus of the program remains on technical capability and a range that covers baroque, pre-classical, classical, romantic and contemporary era. • We may explore AMEB (Australian Music Examinations Board), ABRSM (Royal School of Music) or Trinity College exams, public performances and competitions. • I delve into every aspect of technique, from the very young age to the most advanced levels of performance. This may include customised technical exercises from relevant educators, such as Cortot, Pozzoli & Tausig. • It doesn’t matter where you live in the world – I can undertake online classes via Zoom and deliver masterclasses to overseas students and teachers. • The program extends to Piano, Theory, Aural coaching, Sight Reading, as well as Piano Accompaniment. • Started his music career in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He was only 8 years old when I won 1st Prize on a TV competition for under 14-year-old pianists. • Classically trained in Vienna, Austria under the guidance of Prof Hans Graf. • Owned “Die Muskier Studio” music school in Adelaide, Australia. Prof André K. Economou’s interest in music began at the age of 5 when he started learning the piano in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He was only 8 years old when he won the 1st Prize on a TV competition for under 14-year-old pianists. He was 10 years old when he moved to Athens, Greece and continued his piano studies under the teacher Zoe Agelastou. During his Professorship at the Music University of Athens, the last 9 years of André’s studies was under full scholarship and with the guidance of the Austrian Concert Pianist Prof Max. Hallecker, who was a renowned expert in improving technical development with unique piano exercises. Those skills lead Prof Economou to his teaching career, helping students to overcome technical challenges, whilst developing their emotional side of performance. During the same time, he took special interest in Aural development, Counterpoint and Harmonisation under the guidance of composer Prof Yioannidis. Prof André Economou is proud to say that he has been instrumental in the development of several accomplished piano and string performers, who now have outstanding musical careers in Europe, as well as Australia. One of his motto has always been to provide all technical & emotional secrets in the development of an artist, and the best reward for him as an educator is seeing his students successfully unleashing their inner potential.

Our goal is to preserve these arts, develop well-rounded practitioners and to build a wider martial arts community that moves beyond style boundaries. Learn from one of Australia’s founding Wing Chun Kung Fu schools. You will earn coloured sashes as you learn techniques and forms from Wing Chun and Lung Ying. It is a gradual process that eventually includes several types of partner exercises including Wing Chun’s Chi Sao and Tai Chi’s Tui Sao (push hands). You will also gain sparring experience at the higher levels, through safely-managed exercises and drills. Our kung fu combines two complementary styles that feature explosive, close-range attacks that together make a complete system for self-defence. According to legend, Ng Mui developed her kung fu some 300 years ago in 18th century China, at a time when fighting skills were at a premium. As a Buddhist nun at the Southern Shaolin Temple, she developed both Wing Chun and Lung Ying (Dragon Shape) Kung Fu, amongst other styles. Developing Lung Ying was her lifetime pursuit. She created Wing Chun as a lean, efficient style that could be relatively quickly learnt. Both styles exhibit similar characteristics as practical, close-range fighting arts. Our goal is to develop Ng Mui Kung Fu and train well-rounded practitioners so that we can preserve these arts and build a martial arts community that moves beyond style boundaries.

His students adore him and his love of marital arts is evident when he trains students. Ennio adapts his classes and training strategies to suit the ability and needs of his students. Ennio has the ability to be empathetic and sympathetic, but also teaches students how to feel comfortable about themselves, the way they look and who they are. Ennio personally undertakes the training of his karate students, unlike other clubs who leave this to a head instructor. Ennio gets to know all his students by ensuring they get individually styled teaching; this is done by ensuring classes are kept at reasonable sizes so your child will not be lost in the crowd. Ennio’s study of psychology provides the foundation for perfect blend of life and karate training as he can overcome the most difficult students and teach them self-respect and good manners. Your child will come away with a different perspective on life after attending Shukokai karate classes with Ennio. Ennio encourages children to play other sports; unlike other clubs he plays, games such as soccer in the dojo to warm up before class. Students are always encouraged to play additional sports. Ennio will teach students the meaning of humility, empathy, loyalty and above all patience. Ennio incorporates fitness at his clubs and teaches students the importance of nutrition. Unlike other dojo’s Ennio brings in coaches from around the world to teach at his dojo. If you love your child and want the best for them, then Ennio’s training methods are second to none. Though travelling across the country to share his expertise and decades of knowledge to coach other students, he always puts his club ‘Shukokai Karate Dandenong’ and students first. Students are well nurtured, as Ennio attends all the competitions and rides the waves of emotions with all his students. Ennio can tell by the way your child walks in the door how they are feeling and caters for their individual needs on a daily basis. No other club in Victoria trains this way. Ennio’ s degree in psychology holds him in good stead and he is able to truly understand an individuals needs. Ennio’s prices are the most affordable around Victoria as he does it for the love of karate and it shows in all his students. Come down and speak to his students and all will tell you about the love they have for Sensei Ennio Anselmi. Ennio knows all his students personally and this is what sets his club up for success.

Kids can benefit from co-ordination, mobility and flexibility. Fitness with skill, muscle tone, self-discipline and self-control development. More people are joining karate classes in Melbourne because karate gives them a way to do something fulfilling and rewarding. Karate training brings more than just the physical rewards of increased stamina, coordination, balance, and flexibility. Karate students also develop discipline, focus, respect for others, and goal setting skills. Studies have shown that children who do karate often show significant improvement in concentration and self-discipline – both in school and at home. The emphasis on personal achievement also builds confidence: success is within the reach of every student. Children learn techniques at their own pace. While fighting techniques are part of martial arts, the emphasis is not on teaching children how to fight, but rather teaching them how to respond appropriately when confronted with negative influences such as bullying and peer pressure. Students leave classes with practical confidence-boosting skills. Karate is one of the most popular sports practiced in the world with over 50 million people involved from more than 150 countries. Our competition classes are geared towards competitive athletes who wish to enhance their speed, focus, accuracy, timing and efficiency of movement for local, regional, national and international karate competition. Interested students are required to obtain permission from their instructor. Your coach can answer any questions or concerns that you may have about competing. YOSEIKAN Karate students are encouraged to participate in competitions throughout the year. YOSEIKAN Karate provides additional competition training for members interested in tournaments.

Silks only class if for any student who wants to focus on only aerial silks, it is an open age class and is available to anyone! Tumbling is an additional class to acrobatics that students can participate in focusing on back handsprings front tucks and back tucks and other power based skills. At the young age of 17, I embarked on training at the National Institute of Circus Arts, where I successfully graduated with a Certificate IV in Circus Arts. My dedication and desire to improve has led me to train with some of the world's finest acrobats, earning me qualifications as a contortion trainer under the guidance of Cirque du Soleil contortionists. Over the years I was given the opportunity to work as a student teacher, across different styles in both dance and circus. Since those early years I have found my passion for teaching and been blessed to work independently at different studios across the Greater Melbourne region. This has allowed me to work with students of all ages, abilities including students with special needs.

Julie explores a range of different fluid art techniques. Let your imagination soar and create beautiful vivid pieces of artwork with astonishing, complex gradients. Wow your family and friends. We now have art and craft workshops just for children. These fun small group activities include fluid art, and may include acrylic painting and lots of other arts and crafts. Parents/carers may stay as observers or helpers, but this is not required unless your child needs individualised support. (Please let us know if you want to stay when you book.) If your child is not able to follow instructions or needs more support than one staff to eight children can provide, then please discuss this with Julie prior to booking. Fluid art needs to lie flat to dry, so it cannot be taken home on the day. It can be picked up from the studio in one to three days’ time. Host a unique Birthday party to remember with a fun Fluid Art Class. All children will create an individual art work they are proud of. The group can even work together on an extra one for the birthday guest. You can bring your own refreshments and decorations, or discuss options for a fully catered event. We supply all the art materials and equipment for an easy to arrange and manage special day. Children’s events are normally 2 hours or as negotiated. We love helping people of all backgrounds and experience levels to express their creativity, build skills and confidence and create beautiful art that brings joy and happiness.

Our resident artist Jay takes pride in creating a space for Kids classes that is fun, engaging imagination and play to help them stay excited and empowered in their creations and self expression! Whatever their interest, the goal is to help kids boost their confidence, fine motor skills and self expression in a judgement free environment. Everything in our Art for Kids section holds true in our group classes, however with group classes for kids, we’ve found that the dynamics can be more challenging. Group classes for kids often include family dynamics, competitiveness and often kids across a larger age and therefore skill and interests gap. For that reason, all group classes are priced and accepted on an individual basis, however prices will never be above the maximum class cost. Our resident artist Jay has always had her unique view on the world. From a young age, she loved taking the so-called ‘rules’ of creativity and saying, ‘Sure, but what if we try this?’ When she was young, a perfect day out was a tour of her local art gallery, a trip through the second-hand store and as much time getting messy in the bush, park or backyard as she could get. As she grew, so did her appreciation of art in all of its forms. After leaving school early to pursue styling and fashion and getting the opportunity to work backstage at various runways, she was diagnosed with a rare type of pain disorder. Although this took her away from her work in fashion, it led to a lengthy stay with her Nan, who reignited her love and confidence in art. Art became her escape, her relaxation, her passion; it was everything. She began taking visual arts courses to stay occupied, and it was during creating a final art piece for one of these courses that she decided to take her love of both art and the environment and create beauty. Her first feather was a massive hit, and when it sold, The Painted Feather was created. Since then she has taken her love of art, and her love of both the environment and the history of a preloved item to grow her small business into a beautiful mix of art and function as well as share the freedom of art with others.
